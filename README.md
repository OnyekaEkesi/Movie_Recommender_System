# Movie Recommender System

## Project Description
In this unsupervised machine learning project, we developed a movie recommender system that could predict which movies a user would like to watch, based on their past viewing history and other factors. We considered a variety of machine learning techniques such as collaborative filterating and content-based filteration.

We divided the process into the following phases:
1. Data collection, cleaning and Exploratory data analysis.
2. Model selection and training.
3. Model evaluation and deployment: The metric of evaluation was the RMSE score which indicates the level of clustering of the the dataset. A low RMSE score indicates better clsutering helping us to choose the best performing model. We worked with the SVD, SVD+, Gridsearch and NMF model. among which the best performing model was the SVD.
