# Movie Recommender System

## Project Description
In this unsupervised machine learning project, we developed a movie recommender system which predicts which movies a user would like to watch, based on their past viewing history and other factors. We considered a variety of machine learning techniques such as collaborative filterating and content-based filteration.
