# Movie Recommender System

## Project Description
In this unsupervised machine learning project, we developed a movie recommender system that could predict which movies a user would like to watch, based on their past viewing history and other factors. We considered a variety of machine learning techniques such as collaborative filterating and content-based filteration.

We divided the process into the following phases:
1. Data collection, cleaning and Exploratory data analysis.
2. Model selection and training.
3. Model evaluation and deployment: The metric of evaluation was the RMSE score which indicates the level of clustering of the the dataset. A low RMSE score indicates better clsutering helping us to choose the best performing model. We worked with the SVD, SVD+, Gridsearch and NMF model. among which the best performing model was the SVD.

## Feature
This Project presents a movie recommender app that takes in an input of 3 movie options and returns 10 movie options that are similar in content and rating. The tool is implemented as a web application using Streamlit, which makes it easy to use and interact with. This application enables companies retain its subscribers by providing them an experience that match their taste while eliminating long searches for their preferred kind of movies.

## Tools utilized
